# HostsMod
### Description

In the Minecraft cheating community, it's not uncommon for clients or client cracks/leaks to be malware. The most famous example of this would be the Autumn client "crack", released by Kant. This application attempts to blacklist known hosts of Kant's malware, in order to prevent someone from accidentally getting themselves ratted.

### Domains

    mvncentral.net
    vladvilcu2006.tech
    verble.software
    jonathanhardwick.me
    etc.catering
    batonrogue.tech
    
### Important

One of the domains, "mvncentral.net" is disguised as Maven Central, which is not a malicious site, however "mvncentral.net" is.

Many of the domains may appear to be suspended. This is due to the fact that Kant, the purchaser of the domains and person who spread the malware this program attempts to block, purchased these domains fraudulently. Though they are suspended, I have decided to include them anyways.

### Usage

Run as administrator
