# HostsMod
### Description

In the Minecraft cheating community, it's not uncommon for clients or client cracks/leaks to be malware. The most famous example of this would be the Autumn client "crack", released by Kant. This application attempts to blacklist known hosts of Kant's malware, in order to prevent someone from accidentally getting themselves ratted.

### Important

One of the domains, "mvncentral.net" is disguised as Maven Central, which is not a malicious site, however "mvncentral.net" is.

### Usage
